<p>This project, inspired by the talks from Bret Victor, presents a prototype of the SeeingSpace, focusing on achieving the Seeing inside and Seeing across time concepts. The prototype comprises an observed robotic project and a user interface. The observed robotic project used in this prototype is the JENGA project, where a KUKA robotic arm and a Cognex camera are employed to build a JENGA tower. The user interface utilizes the Node-RED dashboard serving as the interface for visualizing the changing data from the developing project. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) publish-subscribe pattern is utilized as the main communication approach between the JENGA project and the Node-RED dashboard.

<br><br>

The project is guided by six main topics that direct its development process. These topics cover areas such as the utilization of the JENGA project, MQTT communication structure, Node-RED dashboard visualization, camera system, and video playback.
