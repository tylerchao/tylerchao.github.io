This project is my bachelor's thesis, titled "Development of an Inertial-Sensing-Based Intelligent Human-Machine Collaborative Robotic Control System."

<br>
The objective of this project is to develop an inertial-sensing-based intelligent human-machine collaborative robotic control system. 

<br>

The functions of this system include: <br>
1. real-time human motion tracking and remote control; <br>
2. human-machine collaborative monitoring interface. <br>

<br>

We have executed the following four research subjects to accomplish the aforementioned objectives: <br>
1. Develop a wearable sensing device placed on human arm to implement a real-time, convenient, and low-cost wearable body sensor network. <br>
2. Develop a robotic arm control system with high degrees of freedom (DOF) through the robotic arm model analysis. <br>
3. Develop a real-time human motion tracking and control algorithm to integrate the wearable body sensor network and the robotic arm control system for implementing a real-time, convenient, and low-cost intelligent human-machine collaborative robotic control system. <br>
4. Develop a human-machine collaborative monitoring interface to display human motion signals and the results of the human motion tracking. Finally, the experimental results have successfully validated the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent human-machine collaborative robotic control system and its human-machine collaborative monitoring interface. 


<br>

The project is guided by six main topics that direct its development process. These topics cover areas such as the utilization of the JENGA project, MQTT communication structure, Node-RED dashboard visualization, camera system, and video playback.
