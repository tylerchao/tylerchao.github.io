<p>The Maze game has been modified from its original version to offer an enhanced gaming experience. It now comprises four distinct levels, each featuring a unique map with increasing levels of difficulty. The primary objective of the game is to maneuver a ball from the starting point to the exit within a specified time limit.

<br>

As the player successfully completes one level, the next, more challenging level becomes available. The game continues until all four levels have been conquered or until the player fails. 
Additionally, the player's performance is quantified through a scoring system based on completion time. For instance, two points are awarded for completing a level in under one minute, while one point is granted for completing it in more than one minute. In cases where the player fails due to collisions with walls, no score is awarded for that particular game.
