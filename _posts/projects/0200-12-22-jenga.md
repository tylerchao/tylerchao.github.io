<p>

The objective of this project is to enable the KUKA robot arm to clamp and place blocks to construct a JENGA Tower. Specifically, the controller retrieves the coordinates of each block from the Cognex Camera and transmits them to the KUKA robot. A critical phase in this process is Coordinate Transformation, where all block coordinates are converted from virtual (pixel-based) coordinates to real-world coordinates before data transmission. Once the KUKA robot receives the world coordinates, it executes a predefined sequence of movements to assemble the JENGA Tower.

### Action Sequence

1. Block Detection via Cognex Camera:
The Cognex camera captures an image of the workspace containing the scattered blocks.

2. Image Processing:
The camera processes the image to identify the position and orientation of each block in pixel coordinates.

3. Coordinate Transformation:
Using a transformation equation, the pixel coordinates of the blocks are converted into world coordinates (X, Y, Z) relative to the KUKA robot's reference frame.

4. Data Transmission:
The world coordinates of the blocks are transmitted to the KUKA robot through a KuKa robot's internal communication protocol.

5. KUKA Robot Programming:
The robot controller receives the block coordinates and uses them in a pre-defined picking sequence programmed in KUKA Robot Language (KRL).

6. Gripper Alignment and Calibration:
The calibration model ensures that the gripper aligns accurately to pick up each block, compensating for any errors in the block orientation.

7. Pick-and-Place Operation:
The KUKA robot executes the pick-and-place operation, using the provided world coordinates to grip the block and place it in the desired location (e.g., for building a Jenga Tower).
