<p>

The objective of this project is to enable the KUKA robot arm to clamp and place blocks to construct a JENGA Tower. Specifically, the controller retrieves the coordinates of each block from the Cognex Camera and transmits them to the KUKA robot. A critical phase in this process is Coordinate Transformation, where all block coordinates are converted from virtual (pixel-based) coordinates to real-world coordinates before data transmission. Once the KUKA robot receives the world coordinates, it executes a predefined sequence of movements to assemble the JENGA Tower.
