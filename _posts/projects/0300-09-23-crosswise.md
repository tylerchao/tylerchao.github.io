<p>This project is primarily developed using the Java programming language, with IntelliJ IDEA serving as the integrated development environment (IDE). To create the desktop application, the JavaFX library is used to build a graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally, Scene Builder is employed to simplify the integration of FXML markup with the IDE, streamlining the GUI development process.
