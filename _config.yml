description: "Hi, I’m Chien-Hsun, but you can also call me Tyler. I am passionate about robotics and technology innovation, especially humanoid robots. 
              I hold a Master’s degree in IT Engineering from Fachhochschule Wedel, Germany (2023), and a Bachelor’s degree in Automatic Control Engineering with a focus on Biomedical Engineering from Feng Chia University, Taiwan.

              During my academic journey, I have worked on diverse technical projects spanning embedded systems, IT projects, and robotics. These projects allowed me to master various programming languages and 
              tools, including MQTT, IoT communication systems, Python, Java, Embedded C, AutoCAD, MATLAB, RoboDK, and Kuka industrial robots and microcontrollers.

              Currently, I am exploring advanced robotics concepts by self-learning Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and developing a project that integrates gesture recognition with a camera system. 
              This project will be using Python, and C++ as the main programming language. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of humanoid robots that bring significant benefits to humanity"
